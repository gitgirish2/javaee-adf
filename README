This repo will hold my adventures in the Java EE and Oracle ADF world.

XDM 1.0
This demo is based on the example used in the book:
Oracle ADF Enterprise Application Development - Made Simple
by Sten E. Vesterli, 2014 Packt Publishing
The unique features of this book:
- Describe real world ADF development requirements
- How to organize your code structure:
 -- Enterprise Common Workspace (WS) : containing 3 types of projects: (since the demo is tiny, this layer is omitted)
   --- Common Code - hold common utilities, framework extension classes ...
   --- Common Model - hold EOs, LOV VOs, common VOs used by apps, and AM
   --- Common View - hold ADF task flow templates, page templates
   --- Common Skin - hold custom ADF skin definitions for the enterprise
 -- Application Common Workspace (WS) : will inherit all from Enterprise WS and add app-specific contents here
    will contain the same project structure as Enterprise WS
 -- Subsystem WS: one app could contain many subsystems; will inherit all from the App WS
   --- <SubsystemX> Model - hold LOV VOs, VOs specific for this subsystem, and AM
   --- <SubsystemX> View - hold ADF task flows(bounded) and page fragments
 -- Master App WS: will use contents from all above (packaged as ADF libraries)
   -- <App ID> - hold ADF unbounded task flows and pages, ADF unbounded task flows will be rendered in regions (either static
      or dynamic)

- How to create and use ADF Libraries
- Tools used: 
  JDev12c (12.1.2)
  Subversion and Git for VCS
- Database: Oracle XE
